# Scintillate

A UIKit+AppKit-friendly way to either mask content, or show a loading state. Think: SwiftUI's 'redacted'
modifier, for non-SwiftUI applications.

## TODOs:

- [ ] Check tablet appearance + fix rotation behaviour
- [ ] Make color customizable
- [ ] Actually make them shiny (read: animate the layers)
- [ ] All the bugfixes
